**Restaurant picker** 

The aim of the project is to reduce decision fatigue regarding restaurant choice. The web app picks out a restaurant randomly from my google sheet, where I saved decent spots to have some food. 
The file includes only places in Lisbon, where I currently live. 

Another feauture is to allow users put their own suggestions. I set up Google Maps API, so any record user enteres is validated i.e. the function makes a request to check if a particular place exists, the API returns a corresponding response.
